          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them. <br />
          <br />
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>
        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
          extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
          provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
          the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
        </li>

        <header>What you should already know</header>
        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <br />
        <li>
          A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li><br>
        <li>
          Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of
          the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
        </li>
      </section>

      <section id="Hello_world" class="main-section">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          <code
            >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");</code
          >
          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!
        </p>

      <section id="Declaring_variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <br />
        <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
        <code>var x = 42.</code>
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
        <code>x = 42.</code>
        <p>
          This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
          JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        </p>
        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
        <code>let y = 13.</code>
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
          Variable scope below.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="Constants" class="main-section">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <p>
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
          syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
          identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
          can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
        </p>
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
            <br><br>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
            <br><br>
            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
            <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
                WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                //statements }</code>
            <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
            <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                "otherValue";</code>

      <section id="Data_types" class="main-section">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <li>Six data types that are primitives:
            <li class="in-li">Boolean. true and false.</li>
            <li class="in-li">null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
            <li class="in-li">undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li class="in-li">Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li class="in-li">String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li class="in-li">Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
        </li>
        <li>and Object</li>
        <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
